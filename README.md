# Non-overlapping-visual-field-defect-psychophysical-experiments
This repository contains the codes for the psychophysical tests used in the study "Visual functions in non-overlapping visual field defects: dichoptic experiments in healthy subjects with simulated scotomas"

Backstage codes and functions include auxillary codes that are used in the main experiments. To use it put them in your Matlab path.
All codes use Matlab, psychtoolbox and psignifit. Codes were written and tested in Linux.
